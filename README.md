# War
#### Card Game that compares ranks and shows statistics


War is a game of luck in which typically two players will place a card from the top of their hand and compare ranks.

While playing this game with my Dad, we questioned when it would end. I wanted to test the bounds and averages that many simulations of it could produce


As this game is purely based on "luck", each game runs by itself. The only varying component is the random shuffle of each initial hand and every "reserved" winning pile before it is reintroduced into the player's hand.
